# SQL-Calendar
Implementation of creating a calendar table in SQL.

Please note, this repositiory is specific to a use case I had at work. It is not meant to be a solution to a problem that really exists (there's a million implentations of this available).

If you find it useful, I'm glad. 

You are free to use this code, modify it, distibute it, tell me its good, tell me its bad, or even read it to little Coder Jr as a bedtime story.
